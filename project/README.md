Well your partner didn't show up. It happens. But don't be late next time. Coding wise: I'd say your function design is not flexible. It's hard to change things and modify around. It will be very hard to debug. For bigger projects, it will be a pain. Instead of using if else like that, break your functions up. Breaking up functions, is a key to programming. Use abstraction. Print first line, print midline, print last line, etc ... so on. You can have a lot of functions in the future so use them to your advantage.
